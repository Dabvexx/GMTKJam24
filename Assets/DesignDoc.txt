a game about adding weights to scales to make them reach specified positions
there will also be permenant weights added to some scales
something to calculate the amount of weight needed (like hovering over the area will say 3/10th the weight())

also have systems like the rpg roguelink game where you can get special weights and maybe other objects that have very very high weights if needed

find target weights:
add together all possible weights the user has
multiply by 1.2
